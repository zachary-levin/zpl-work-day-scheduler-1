## Goal
The main goal of this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.  

## What I learned
In this project, I learned how to use third-party APIs such as Moment.js to handle the date and time for the application, as well as utilize Bootstrap for adjusting the layout of elements.
