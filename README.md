## Goal
The main goal of this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events in hourly time blocks, from 9 AM to 5 PM.  

## Why this project was built
The project was made to provide users acess to a simple application that lets them schedule tasks in hour-long blocks, from 9 AM to 5 PM.

## What I learned
In this project, I learned how to use third-party APIs such as Moment.js to handle the date and time for the application, as well as utilize Bootstrap for adjusting the layout of elements. I wish I also figured out how to properly space the rows and columns to make it more like the demonstration.

## Challenges of this project
The challenges I faced with this project was not having as much time as I would like to work on this, and I feel that I did not understand Bootstrap as well as I did, especially with regards to the Grid system and Bootstrap theme colors.
